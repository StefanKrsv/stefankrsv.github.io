## Lamp Selection

For this project, the ideal lamp should be both affordable and provide ample space for modifications. IKEA offers the BARLAST lamp, which is priced between 5-6 euros, making it a suitable choice.

## Presence Sensor

The first sensor that comes to mind is the PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, commonly utilized in Arduino projects. While PIR sensors are effective at detecting motion, they fall short in sensing continuous presence. In contrast, radar sensors based on the Doppler effect excel in detecting motion, presence, and even distance. Among these, the LD2410B radar sensor available on AliExpress stands out as the best option.

## Power Supply Considerations

A standard 5-volt power supply will not suffice for this radar sensor, as it has specific power requirements. The power supply must exhibit low noise and minimal ripple to ensure reliable performance. The HLK-PM01 power module, from the same manufacturer, meets these criteria and is recommended.

## Relay Selection

To ensure the lamp operates without any audible noise during activation, a solid-state relay is required.
