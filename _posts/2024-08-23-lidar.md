## The idea

A few weeks ago, I remembered the popular LIDAR game mode from GMod and thought it would be cool to remake it for AR. In this AR version, you can perform a burst scan as well as a small scan. The radius of the small scan can be controlled with a joystick. The real environment (which is AR) is captured from Quest using Oculus Integration. On Oculus Quest 2, the environment is represented as a set of planes and volumes, but on Quest 3, it is a global mesh, which provides much more detail. The game runs natively on the Quest platform, and both performance and visual quality are excellent. Made in Unity. And there you have it!
